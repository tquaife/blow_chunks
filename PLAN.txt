X1. Implement a new parser that checks for commands
X2. Have a "control" data structure that gets passed down and can store stuff from commands
X3. As a first pass, add a "neutral" command -- print
X4. Commands start with @, e.g. @print
X5. Move to @volume and implement the volume change via the top level oscillators -> needs a "volume" entry in the data structure.
6. Next up @sequence with arguments of start and duration
