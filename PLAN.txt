** Main todo list:

Envelopes
- tidy up modulator parsing first?

New oscillators
- rand square
- sqrt sin
- triangle wave
- swap old sawtooths for trig functions

Normalise
- use buffer for sounds
- write one waveform at time
- slower but more robust


** Debugging required: 

??? Probably loads

** Recently completed

tri->sup
Math parser
re-write command line parser
solved stack overflow on big input files

** Possible new commands:
- @randu var1 [var2 [var3 [...]]]
- @randu_scale scale
- @repeat n | @end_repeat

- Include blow_chunks file
- Preview ?? (or via command line)
- Tracks ??
