X1. Implement a new parser that checks for commands
X2. Have a "control" data structure that gets passed down and can store stuff from commands
X3. As a first pass, add a "neutral" command -- print
X4. Commands start with @, e.g. @print
X5. Move to @volume and implement the volume change via the top level oscillators -> needs a "volume" entry in the data structure.
X6. Next up @sequence with arguments of start and duration
---
X7. Remove fast faders
X8. Read @sequence command & add to control structure (start + duration) & add to top nodes
X9. Rewrite calculate sample function to have a local time for each top node, zero outside start<->(start+duration)
X10. Implement fast faders for each top node
X11. Get max length (=max((start+duration)[:])
X12. Add duration (or length) to the control structure 


**** Future:

DEBUG tri

Math parser
Normalise
Envelopes
Lots of new ocillators
re-write command line parser


New commands:
- Include blow_chunks file
- Preview ?? (or via command line)
- Tracks ??
