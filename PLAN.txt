** Main todo list:

Envelopes
- rewrite oscillator parser first [DONE]
- add exponential envelope for frequency parts
-- essentially a new version of get_envelope_value()

New oscillators
- rand square
- sqrt sin
- triangle wave
- swap old sawtooths for trig functions

Normalise
- use buffer for sounds
- write one waveform at time
- slower but more robust

Shape parameter (?)
- add a forth argument for each oscillator that controls "shape"
- needs to be controlled by envelopes and modulations same as everything else

Other
- error checking on strtod calls (and similar)


** Debugging required: 

- check phase envelopes and modulations
- is FM working as expected?
- maths not working inside envelopes (tripped up by ":")

** Recently completed

simplified math parsing logic (removed do-while loop)
tri->sup (because it's a sawtooth, not a triangle)
Math parser
re-write command line parser
solved stack overflow on big input files

** Possible new commands:
- @randu var1 [var2 [var3 [...]]]
- @randu_scale scale
- @repeat n | @end_repeat

- Include blow_chunks file
- Preview ?? (or via command line)
- Tracks ??
- echo on/off ??
- block define/insert ??
